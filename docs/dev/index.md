# bbrx developer documentation
Welcome to bbrx's developer docs!  These notes aim to document the architecture of bbrx, and explain its inner workings.  They aren't really intended as documentation on how to use the system (for that, see [the usage docs](../usage)), and expect familiarity withe bbrx's main concepts.

- there aren't any notes yet T_T
