# Status LED
bbrx has support for a status LED to show at a glance what the program's currently doing.  This can be useful for whenever you aren't monitoring (or can't monitor) the serial output generated by bbrx.  To generate the correct output for the LED, bbrx uses the incredible [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library!

This feature is designed to use a RGB LED (eg: Neopixel, WS2812B, etc), such as those which can be found on many popular ESP32 boards.  Please check this page's section on configuration to make sure you are using the right pin!

## LED Colours
Here are the colours which the LED can show, and what they mean:

| Colour    | Pulsing | Meaning                                          |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Off       | N/A     | ESP32 is powered off or something has gone wrong |
| Green     | No      | Loading config.yml and booting bbrx              |
| Blue      | Yes     | bbrx is ready, waiting to connect to a gamepad   |
| Cyan      | No      | Connected to a gamepad and ready to go!          |
| Red       | No      | The brake is engaged                             |

## Configuration
The settings for the status LED are defined in [`config.h`](../../bbrx/config.h#L90), around line 90 at the time of writing.  The currently supported settings are:
- `STATUS_LED_PIN`: the pin to use for LED output
- `STATUS_LED_POWER_PIN`: if defined, this pin will be pulled high.  this exists because some boards with built-in RGB LEDs use a GPIO to power the LED
- `STATUS_NUM_LEDS`: the number of LEDs in the chain.  for now, bbrx doesn't actually use anything other than the first one for status
- `STATUS_LED_TYPE`: which type of LED driver you are using.  please refer to [fastled's chipset reference](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference) for details on what chipsets / drivers are supported
- `STATUS_LED_INIT_BRIGHTNESS`: the initial brightness of the LED.  the brightness can be changed at runtime using a function in `status_led.cpp` but that isn't actually used at the time of writing
